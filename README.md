`npm run link:fix`

This command runs eslint and targets all .ts files. If using something like mustache that uses `.css/.scss` or `.html` files
you will have to add those files extesions to the command in the `package.json` file.

This command runs prettier throughout the project. Again, make sure to add any extra filetypes to the command
in the `package.json` file.
